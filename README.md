# User Management GUI

## Description

The goal of this project is to build an graphical interface for a user management application using Java Swing.
The project should cover the following minimum requirements:

1. Adding new users
2. Displaying a list of all currently registered users:
    - Format: \<Number> \<Username> (\<Admin>, \<Email address>)
3. Checking if the user already exists:
    - by username or
    - by email address
4. Maximum number of users to register: 19
5. Functional implementation of a progress bar and counter

## Installation

As the project is currently in its development phase, it can only be executed within a suitable development environment such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or similiar.

## Usage

A new user is created by entering a username, email address and password. If the user has administration rights select the checkbox accordingly. Click the "Create User" button. If the entered information is valid (no duplicates), the user will be displayed in the list. The maximum number of users that can be created is 19.

## Roadmap

The project is intended as preparation for a more extensive project which is to be developed during the course of the second semester.

## Contributing

As the project is being developed as part of the course "Programming 2" and therefore will be used for grading purposes, participation in the project is not possible.
