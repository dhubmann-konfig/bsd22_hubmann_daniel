# How To Write...

## Good Source Code Comments

- Do not duplicate your source code
- If your code is written in an unclear way, a good comment won't fix it
- If you cannot come with a concise comment, the problem lies within in your code
- Do not cause confusion or complications with your comment
- Explain possible unusual behaviour
- Provide links to the original source code
- Provide links to external references
- Use TODO to mark incomplete areas in your code
- Remove wrong old comments

## Good Commit Messages

- General Layout: Heading, (empty row), Main text
- Heading should be 50 characters or less
- Main text should line break after 72 characters
- The main text describes the what and why (not the how)
- Short messages can only contain a one-line heading
- The heading should start with a capital letter
- No dot at the end of the heading
- Use imperative: Good messages should complete "If applied, this commit will..."
